Welcome to Commitmas 2016! 

We will be building out a few cookbooks and resoures that will assist in deploying LAMP stacks into docker objects. This doesn't need to be a single cookbook, but we can build out different cookbooks as we see fit. 

The goal of this commitmas is to learn Git and the processes associated with that. For our project, I would like things to be branched off the main repo and then pull requests submitted. If you would like to fork it, that is ok as well to help you understand how that works. Please let me know if you have any questions and happy coding! 

Thanks,

Jesse
